In this file, we take a look at Billboard Hot 100 Data from the past few decades. Within this project we clean this dataset, organize it, identify key variables such as Valence (used to assess whether a song is a happy or sad mood) and its relation to a song being a Number 1 Hit. We end this project with a statistical assessment on such relation and a visualization to aid the result.
